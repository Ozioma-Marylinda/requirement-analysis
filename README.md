## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

#### This repository is built for **exploring** one of the most crucial stages of the software development life cycle: Requirement Analysis. It serves as a foundational step where project goals, user needs, and system expectations are clearly defined before development begins.

#### Through this repository, we will break down the processes, types, techniques, and best practices for gathering and analyzing requirements to build successful, user-centered software products. This project is part of my journey in learning software engineering and building better, smarter applications.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

#### Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
2. Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
3. Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
4. Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
5. Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

* **Requirement Gathering:**
  Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, and reviewing existing systems to understand their needs.

* **Requirement Elicitation:**
  Using brainstorming, focus groups, and prototypes to engage stakeholders and draw out detailed and hidden requirements.

* **Requirement Documentation:**
  Clearly recording all gathered requirements in formats like specification documents, user stories, and use case diagrams.

* **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**
  Analyzing requirements for feasibility, prioritizing them, and using visual models to represent how the system should behave.

* **Requirement Validation:**
  Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders, defining acceptance criteria, and ensuring all requirements are traceable and testable.

## Types of Requirements.

### Functional Requirements 
**Definition:** Describe what the system should do.  
**Examples:** User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

### Non-functional Requirements 
**Definition:** Describe how the system should perform.  
**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

## Use Case Diagrams.

#### Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

* **Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.**
* ** Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.**
* ** Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.**

## Acceptance Criteria.

## Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Acceptance criteria are essential in requirement analysis because they:

- Ensure **all stakeholders have a shared understanding** of the system's functionalities.
- Provide a **concrete basis for testing and validation**, reducing ambiguity.
- Help in **maintaining system quality** and ensuring features meet **user expectations**.

### Example â€“ Checkout Feature (Booking Management System)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users must be able to **review selected property details** before proceeding to payment.
