## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

### This repository is built for **exploring** one of the most crucial stages of the software development life cycle: Requirement Analysis. It serves as a foundational step where project goals, user needs, and system expectations are clearly defined before development begins.

### Through this repository, we will break down the processes, types, techniques, and best practices for gathering and analyzing requirements to build successful, user-centered software products. This project is part of my journey in learning software engineering and building better, smarter applications.
